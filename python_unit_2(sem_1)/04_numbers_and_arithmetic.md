## 1. What Is Arithmetic in Python?

**Arithmetic** means performing mathematical calculations.

Python can perform common mathematical operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Floor division
- Modulus
- Exponentiation

For example:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)
```

Output:

```text
15
```

Python can perform these calculations using **arithmetic operators**.

---

# 2. Arithmetic Operators

An **arithmetic operator** is a symbol used to perform a mathematical operation.

Python provides several arithmetic operators:

| Operator | Name | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `+` | Addition | `10 + 3` | `13` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 3` | `7` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `10 * 3` | `30` |
| `/` | Division | `10 / 3` | `3.333...` |
| `//` | Floor division | `10 // 3` | `3` |
| `%` | Modulus | `10 % 3` | `1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `10 ** 3` | `1000` |

We will study each operator carefully.

---

# 3. Integer Operations

When arithmetic is performed using integer values, we call them **integer operations**.

For example:

```python
a = 10
b = 3
```

Here, both `a` and `b` refer to integers.

---

## 3.1 Integer Addition

The `+` operator performs addition.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)
```

Output:

```text
13
```

The values are added:

```text
10 + 3 = 13
```

---

## 3.2 Integer Subtraction

The `-` operator performs subtraction.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a - b)
```

Output:

```text
7
```

The calculation is:

```text
10 - 3 = 7
```

---

## 3.3 Integer Multiplication

The `*` operator performs multiplication.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a * b)
```

Output:

```text
30
```

The calculation is:

```text
10 × 3 = 30
```

---

## 3.4 Integer Division

The `/` operator performs division.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a / b)
```

Output:

```text
3.3333333333333335
```

Notice that the result is a floating-point value.

This is an important Python behavior:

> **The `/` operator produces a floating-point result, even when both operands are integers.**

For example:

```python
print(10 / 2)
```

Output:

```text
5.0
```

The mathematical result is `5`, but Python represents the result as `5.0`.

---

# 4. Floating-Point Operations

Arithmetic can also be performed using floating-point numbers.

For example:

```python
price = 99.5
discount = 10.0
```

These values are floating-point numbers.

---

## 4.1 Floating-Point Addition

```python
a = 10.5
b = 2.5

print(a + b)
```

Output:

```text
13.0
```

---

## 4.2 Floating-Point Subtraction

```python
a = 10.5
b = 2.5

print(a - b)
```

Output:

```text
8.0
```

---

## 4.3 Floating-Point Multiplication

```python
a = 10.5
b = 2.0

print(a * b)
```

Output:

```text
21.0
```

---

## 4.4 Floating-Point Division

```python
a = 10.5
b = 2.0

print(a / b)
```

Output:

```text
5.25
```

Floating-point calculations can sometimes produce results with many decimal places because of the way computers represent decimal values internally.

For example:

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2)
```

may produce:

```text
0.30000000000000004
```

This does not mean Python's arithmetic is randomly wrong. It is related to how floating-point numbers are represented internally by computers.

We will discuss floating-point precision in more detail when it becomes necessary.

---

# 5. Addition `+`

The `+` operator adds two values.

### Example

```python
a = 20
b = 5

print(a + b)
```

Output:

```text
25
```

### With Floating-Point Numbers

```python
a = 20.5
b = 5.5

print(a + b)
```

Output:

```text
26.0
```

---

# 6. Subtraction `-`

The `-` operator subtracts the second value from the first.

### Example

```python
a = 20
b = 5

print(a - b)
```

Output:

```text
15
```

### Important

The order matters.

```python
20 - 5
```

is different from:

```python
5 - 20
```

The results are:

```text
20 - 5 = 15
5 - 20 = -15
```

---

# 7. Multiplication `*`

The `*` operator performs multiplication.

Example:

```python
price = 100
quantity = 3

print(price * quantity)
```

Output:

```text
300
```

This can represent a simple real-world calculation:

```text
Price × Quantity = Total
```

---

# 8. Division `/`

The `/` operator performs normal division.

Example:

```python
print(15 / 3)
```

Output:

```text
5.0
```

Another example:

```python
print(7 / 2)
```

Output:

```text
3.5
```

### Important Rule

The `/` operator produces a floating-point result.

For example:

```python
print(8 / 2)
```

produces:

```text
4.0
```

not:

```text
4
```

---

# 9. Floor Division `//`

The `//` operator is called **floor division**.

It performs division and returns the floor of the result.

### Basic Example

```python
print(10 // 3)
```

Output:

```text
3
```

Normal division gives:

```text
10 / 3 = 3.333...
```

Floor division gives:

```text
10 // 3 = 3
```

### Important

Floor division is **not simply "remove everything after the decimal point"**.

It moves the result toward the smaller integer value.

For positive values:

```text
10 // 3 = 3
```

because:

```text
10 / 3 = 3.333...
```

and the floor is `3`.

---

## 9.1 Floor Division with Exact Division

Consider:

```python
print(12 // 3)
```

Output:

```text
4
```

Because:

```text
12 / 3 = 4
```

There is no fractional part to remove.

---

## 9.2 Floor Division with Negative Numbers

Negative numbers make floor division especially important.

Consider:

```python
print(-10 // 3)
```

Output:

```text
-4
```

Why?

Normal division gives approximately:

```text
-3.333...
```

The floor is the next smaller integer:

```text
-4
```

So:

```text
-10 // 3 = -4
```

> **Remember:** Floor division moves toward negative infinity, not simply toward zero.

---

# 10. Modulus `%`

The `%` operator is called the **modulus** or **remainder operator**.

It gives the remainder after division.

### Example

```python
print(10 % 3)
```

Output:

```text
1
```

Because:

```text
10 ÷ 3
```

gives:

```text
Quotient = 3
Remainder = 1
```

Therefore:

```text
10 % 3 = 1
```

---

## 10.1 More Modulus Examples

```python
print(10 % 2)
```

Output:

```text
0
```

Because `10` divides exactly by `2`.

Another example:

```python
print(17 % 5)
```

Output:

```text
2
```

Because:

```text
17 = 5 × 3 + 2
```

So the remainder is `2`.

---

## 10.2 Modulus with Real-World Examples

Modulus is useful when we need to know the remainder after dividing something into equal groups.

### Example

Suppose there are 17 students and we make groups of 5.

```python
students = 17
group_size = 5

print(students % group_size)
```

Output:

```text
2
```

This means 2 students remain after making complete groups of 5.

We will later use modulus in many practical programming problems.

---

# 11. Exponentiation `**`

The `**` operator is used for **exponentiation**.

It means raising one value to the power of another.

### Example

```python
print(2 ** 3)
```

Output:

```text
8
```

Because:

```text
2 × 2 × 2 = 8
```

So:

```text
2 ** 3 = 8
```

---

## 11.1 More Examples

```python
print(5 ** 2)
```

Output:

```text
25
```

Because:

```text
5 × 5 = 25
```

Another example:

```python
print(10 ** 3)
```

Output:

```text
1000
```

---

## 11.2 Square and Cube

Exponentiation can be used to calculate squares and cubes.

### Square

```python
number = 6

print(number ** 2)
```

Output:

```text
36
```

### Cube

```python
number = 4

print(number ** 3)
```

Output:

```text
64
```

---

# 12. Arithmetic Operators Summary

| Operator | Name | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `+` | Addition | `8 + 3` | `11` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `8 - 3` | `5` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `8 * 3` | `24` |
| `/` | Division | `8 / 3` | `2.666...` |
| `//` | Floor division | `8 // 3` | `2` |
| `%` | Modulus | `8 % 3` | `2` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `8 ** 3` | `512` |

---

# 13. Operator Precedence

When an expression contains more than one operator, Python needs rules to decide **which operation should be performed first**.

These rules are called **operator precedence**.

### Example

Consider:

```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2
```

A beginner might calculate from left to right:

```text
10 + 5 = 15
15 × 2 = 30
```

But Python follows operator precedence.

Multiplication is performed before addition:

```text
5 × 2 = 10
10 + 10 = 20
```

Therefore:

```python
print(10 + 5 * 2)
```

Output:

```text
20
```

---

# 14. Basic Precedence Order

For the arithmetic operators covered in this topic, a useful simplified order is:

1. `()` Parentheses
2. `**` Exponentiation
3. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. `+`, `-`

So, in general:

```text
Parentheses
      ↓
Exponentiation
      ↓
Multiplication / Division / Floor Division / Modulus
      ↓
Addition / Subtraction
```

---

# 15. Parentheses `()`

Parentheses can be used to explicitly control the order of calculation.

Consider:

```python
result = (10 + 5) * 2
```

First:

```text
10 + 5 = 15
```

Then:

```text
15 × 2 = 30
```

So:

```python
print((10 + 5) * 2)
```

Output:

```text
30
```

Compare this with:

```python
print(10 + 5 * 2)
```

Output:

```text
20
```

The parentheses changed the order of evaluation.

---

# 16. Exponentiation and Precedence

Exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication and addition.

Example:

```python
print(2 + 3 ** 2)
```

First:

```text
3 ** 2 = 9
```

Then:

```text
2 + 9 = 11
```

Output:

```text
11
```

It is not:

```text
(2 + 3) ** 2
```

which would produce:

```text
25
```

If that is what we want, we must use parentheses:

```python
print((2 + 3) ** 2)
```

Output:

```text
25
```

---

# 17. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, and Modulus

These operators have the same general precedence level.

When operators at the same level appear together, Python evaluates them from **left to right**.

Example:

```python
print(20 / 5 * 2)
```

The calculation proceeds from left to right:

```text
20 / 5 = 4.0
4.0 * 2 = 8.0
```

Output:

```text
8.0
```

Similarly:

```python
print(20 // 3 * 2)
```

First:

```text
20 // 3 = 6
```

Then:

```text
6 * 2 = 12
```

Output:

```text
12
```

---

# 18. Addition and Subtraction

Addition and subtraction have the same precedence level.

They are evaluated from left to right.

Example:

```python
print(20 - 5 + 2)
```

First:

```text
20 - 5 = 15
```

Then:

```text
15 + 2 = 17
```

Output:

```text
17
```

If you want a different order, use parentheses:

```python
print(20 - (5 + 2))
```

Output:

```text
13
```

---

# 19. Mixed Arithmetic Expression

Let's look at a more complete example:

```python
result = 10 + 6 * 2 - 8 / 4
```

Python follows precedence.

### Step 1: Multiplication

```text
6 * 2 = 12
```

### Step 2: Division

```text
8 / 4 = 2.0
```

### Step 3: Addition and subtraction from left to right

```text
10 + 12 - 2.0
```

Then:

```text
22 - 2.0 = 20.0
```

So:

```python
print(result)
```

produces:

```text
20.0
```

---

# 20. Use Parentheses to Make Expressions Clear

Even when you know operator precedence, parentheses can make your intention easier to understand.

For example:

```python
total = (price * quantity) + delivery_charge
```

This clearly shows that the product of `price` and `quantity` is calculated first.

Good parentheses can make code easier to read and reduce mistakes.

---

# 21. Real-World Arithmetic Example

Suppose a shop sells a product for ₹100 and a customer buys 3 units.

```python
price = 100
quantity = 3

total = price * quantity

print(total)
```

Output:

```text
300
```

Here:

```text
price × quantity
= 100 × 3
= 300
```

---

## 21.1 Example with Remaining Items

Suppose a shop has 17 items and wants to put them into boxes of 5.

```python
items = 17
box_size = 5

complete_boxes = items // box_size
remaining_items = items % box_size

print(complete_boxes)
print(remaining_items)
```

Output:

```text
3
2
```

This means:

- 3 complete boxes can be filled.
- 2 items remain.

This is a practical use of both `//` and `%`.

---

# 22. Common Beginner Mistakes

## Mistake 1: Confusing `/` and `//`

```text
10 / 3  → 3.333...
10 // 3 → 3
```

`/` performs normal division.

`//` performs floor division.

---

## Mistake 2: Thinking `%` Means Percentage

In Python arithmetic:

```text
%
```

is the **modulus operator**.

It gives the remainder after division.

For example:

```python
print(10 % 3)
```

Output:

```text
1
```

---

## Mistake 3: Confusing `**` with `*`

```text
2 * 3  → 6
2 ** 3 → 8
```

`*` means multiplication.

`**` means exponentiation.

---

## Mistake 4: Calculating Only from Left to Right

Consider:

```python
10 + 5 * 2
```

Do not calculate:

```text
(10 + 5) * 2
```

Python performs multiplication first:

```text
10 + (5 * 2)
```

Result:

```text
20
```

---

## Mistake 5: Forgetting Parentheses

Compare:

```python
10 + 5 * 2
```

and:

```python
(10 + 5) * 2
```

Results:

```text
20
30
```

Parentheses can change the result.

---

## Mistake 6: Assuming Floor Division Simply Removes Decimals

For positive values:

```text
10 // 3 = 3
```

But with negative values:

```text
-10 // 3 = -4
```

Floor division moves toward negative infinity.

---

# 23. Quick Comparison

| Operation | Operator | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Addition | `+` | `10 + 3` | `13` |
| Subtraction | `-` | `10 - 3` | `7` |
| Multiplication | `*` | `10 * 3` | `30` |
| Division | `/` | `10 / 3` | `3.333...` |
| Floor division | `//` | `10 // 3` | `3` |
| Modulus | `%` | `10 % 3` | `1` |
| Exponentiation | `**` | `10 ** 3` | `1000` |

---

# 24. Key Points to Remember

1. Python can perform arithmetic calculations using arithmetic operators.
2. `+` is used for addition.
3. `-` is used for subtraction.
4. `*` is used for multiplication.
5. `/` is used for normal division and produces a floating-point result.
6. `//` is used for floor division.
7. `%` gives the remainder after division.
8. `**` is used for exponentiation.
9. Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed.
10. Parentheses have higher priority and can be used to control the order of calculation.
11. Exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, addition, and subtraction.
12. Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus are generally evaluated from left to right when they occur at the same precedence level.
13. Addition and subtraction are generally evaluated from left to right when they occur at the same precedence level.
14. Floor division should not be confused with simply removing decimal digits, especially for negative numbers.
15. Arithmetic operators can be used together to build larger expressions.

# Quick Revision Activity

Before moving to the next topic, make sure you can explain these operators with your own examples:

```text
+   → Addition
-   → Subtraction
*   → Multiplication
/   → Division
//  → Floor division
%   → Modulus
**  → Exponentiation
```

Also make sure you can solve an expression such as:

```python
10 + 5 * 2
```

by applying operator precedence instead of simply calculating from left to right.
