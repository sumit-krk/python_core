# 2.2 Variables

## Objective

After completing this topic, you should be able to understand:

- What are variables?
- Variables and assignment
- Reassignment
- Variable naming rules
- Naming conventions
- Multiple assignment

> **Prerequisite:** You should understand the basic ideas of Python, Python files, basic syntax, comments, and code readability from the previous topic.

---

## 1. What Is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name used to refer to a value in a program.

In simple words:

> **A variable is a named place/reference used to store or keep a value so that we can use that value later.**

For example:

```python
name = "Rahul"
```

Here:

- `name` is the variable name.
- `"Rahul"` is the value.
- `=` is used to assign the value to the variable.

We can think of it like this:

```text
name  →  "Rahul"
```

The variable `name` now refers to the value `"Rahul"`.

### Another Example

```python
age = 18
```

Here:

- `age` is the variable name.
- `18` is the value.

So we can imagine:

```text
age  →  18
```

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Variables?

Variables allow us to give meaningful names to values.

Suppose a program needs to work with a student's name.

Instead of repeatedly thinking about the actual value:

```text
"Rahul"
```

we can give it a meaningful name:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

Now the program can refer to the value using:

```text
student_name
```

This makes the code easier to understand.

### Example

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
student_age = 18
```

From the variable names, we can understand what the values represent.

This is much easier to understand than using unclear names.

---

## 3. Variables and Assignment

The process of giving a value to a variable is called **assignment**.

In Python, we commonly use the `=` symbol for assignment.

### Example

```python
name = "Rahul"
```

This means:

> Assign the value `"Rahul"` to the variable `name`.

It does **not** mean that `name` and `"Rahul"` are mathematically equal.

### More Examples

```python
age = 18
marks = 85
city = "Patna"
```

The assignments can be understood as:

```text
age    → 18
marks  → 85
city   → "Patna"
```

---

## 4. Assignment Happens from Right to Left

A useful beginner rule is:

> **The value on the right side is assigned to the variable on the left side.**

For example:

```python
age = 18
```

Think of it as:

```text
18  →  age
```

Another example:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

Think of it as:

```text
"Rahul"  →  student_name
```

### Important

Do not read:

```python
age = 18
```

as:

> "age equals 18" in the mathematical sense.

For programming, a better way to understand it is:

> "Put or assign the value 18 into the variable named age."

---

## 5. Using a Variable

Once a value has been assigned to a variable, we can use the variable name in the program.

Example:

```python
name = "Rahul"

print(name)
```

Output:

```text
Rahul
```

Here:

1. `"Rahul"` is assigned to `name`.
2. `name` is then used in the next instruction.
3. The value referred to by `name` is displayed.

> We are using `print()` here only to demonstrate the value of a variable. The detailed working of `print()` was introduced earlier and will be studied separately.

---

## 6. Variables Can Refer to Different Types of Values

A variable can refer to different kinds of values.

For example:

```python
name = "Rahul"
age = 18
height = 5.8
```

Here:

- `name` refers to text.
- `age` refers to a whole number.
- `height` refers to a decimal number.

We will study Python's data types in detail in a later topic.

For now, remember:

> **A variable is a name that refers to a value.**

---

## 7. Reassignment

A variable does not have to keep the same value forever.

We can assign a new value to an existing variable. This is called **reassignment**.

### Example

```python
age = 18
age = 19
```

First:

```text
age → 18
```

After the second assignment:

```text
age → 19
```

The variable now refers to the new value.

### Another Example

```python
name = "Rahul"
name = "Amit"
```

Initially:

```text
name → "Rahul"
```

After reassignment:

```text
name → "Amit"
```

The previous value is no longer the current value referred to by `name`.

---

## 8. Why Is Reassignment Useful?

Reassignment is useful when a value needs to change during the execution of a program.

For example, suppose a student's score changes after another assessment:

```python
marks = 70
marks = 85
```

The variable `marks` now refers to `85`.

Similarly:

```python
temperature = 25
temperature = 28
```

The variable can represent the updated value.

---

## 9. A Common Beginner Mistake: `=` Does Not Mean "Same As"

Consider:

```python
age = 18
```

A beginner may think that `=` means mathematical equality.

In Python, in this context, `=` is the **assignment operator**.

It tells Python to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.

Later, we will study operators used for comparisons. Do not confuse those concepts with assignment.

---

# 10. Variable Naming Rules

Python has rules about which names can be used for variables.

Following these rules is necessary for Python to understand the name correctly.

## Rule 1: A Variable Name Can Contain Letters

Examples:

```python
name = "Rahul"
age = 18
student = "Amit"
```

Letters can be used in variable names.

---

## Rule 2: A Variable Name Can Contain Numbers

Numbers can also appear in a variable name.

For example:

```python
student1 = "Rahul"
room2 = "Lab"
```

However, there is an important rule:

> **A variable name cannot start with a number.**

This is invalid:

```python
1student = "Rahul"
```

A better name would be:

```python
student1 = "Rahul"
```

---

## Rule 3: A Variable Name Can Contain an Underscore

The underscore `_` can be used in variable names.

Examples:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
total_marks = 85
phone_number = "12345"
```

Underscores are especially useful for making multi-word names readable.

---

## Rule 4: A Variable Name Cannot Contain Spaces

This is not a valid variable name:

```python
student name = "Rahul"
```

There is a space between `student` and `name`.

Instead, use an underscore:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

---

## Rule 5: Variable Names Are Case-Sensitive

Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different.

For example:

```text
name
Name
NAME
```

are different names.

Consider:

```python
name = "Rahul"
Name = "Amit"
```

These are two different variable names.

### Important

Be consistent with capitalization to avoid confusion.

---

## Rule 6: A Variable Name Cannot Be a Python Keyword

Python has some reserved words called **keywords**.

These words already have a special meaning in Python and cannot normally be used as variable names.

Examples include:

```text
if
else
for
while
class
def
return
```

> **Important:** These keywords are shown here only so you know that reserved words exist. We will learn their actual meanings later. Do not worry about using them yet.

For example, using a keyword as a variable name is not valid:

```python
class = "B.Tech"
```

We should choose another name instead.

---

## 11. Valid and Invalid Variable Names

### Valid Examples

```python
name = "Rahul"
age = 18
student_name = "Amit"
student1 = "Riya"
_total = 100
```

### Invalid Examples

```python
1student = "Rahul"
student name = "Rahul"
student-name = "Rahul"
class = "B.Tech"
```

### Why Are Some Names Invalid?

| Name | Valid? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `student_name` | Yes | Uses letters and underscore |
| `student1` | Yes | Number is not at the beginning |
| `1student` | No | Cannot start with a number |
| `student name` | No | Spaces are not allowed |
| `student-name` | No | `-` is not used as part of a normal variable name |
| `class` | No | It is a Python keyword |

---

# 12. Naming Conventions

Naming **rules** tell us what names are allowed.

Naming **conventions** are recommended ways of writing names so that code remains consistent and readable.

This distinction is important:

> **Rules tell us what we can write. Conventions tell us what we should preferably write.**

---

## 13. `snake_case`

Python commonly recommends **snake_case** for variable names.

In snake_case:

- Use lowercase letters.
- Separate multiple words using underscores.

Examples:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
total_marks = 85
phone_number = "12345"
college_name = "ABC College"
```

These names are easy to read.

### Poorer Style

```python
studentname = "Rahul"
totalmarks = 85
phonenumber = "12345"
```

These may be valid names, but the words are less visually separated.

---

## 14. Use Meaningful Names

A variable name should communicate what the value represents.

### Good Examples

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
student_age = 18
total_marks = 450
college_name = "ABC College"
```

### Less Meaningful Examples

```python
x = "Rahul"
a = 18
t = 450
c = "ABC College"
```

The second set may be valid in some situations, but the names do not clearly communicate their purpose.

### Important

A meaningful name is not necessarily a long name.

For example:

```python
age = 18
```

is better than:

```python
student_current_age_in_years = 18
```

when the shorter name is already clear in context.

---

## 15. Avoid Unnecessary Abbreviations

Prefer clear names.

Instead of:

```python
stu_nm = "Rahul"
```

prefer:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

The second name is immediately understandable.

However, commonly understood abbreviations may sometimes be acceptable when their meaning is obvious.

---

## 16. Be Consistent

Use one naming style consistently throughout a program.

For example, if you use:

```python
student_name
student_age
student_city
```

continue using the same style rather than randomly switching to:

```python
studentName
StudentAge
studentcity
```

Consistency makes code easier to read.

---

# 17. Multiple Assignment

Python allows us to assign values to multiple variables in a single statement.

This is called **multiple assignment**.

### Example

```python
name, age, city = "Rahul", 18, "Patna"
```

This assigns:

```text
name → "Rahul"
age  → 18
city → "Patna"
```

It is equivalent in meaning to:

```python
name = "Rahul"
age = 18
city = "Patna"
```

The multiple-assignment form is simply a concise way to perform these assignments together.

---

## 18. Multiple Assignment with the Same Value

Python also allows the same value to be assigned to multiple variables.

Example:

```python
x = y = z = 0
```

This means:

```text
x → 0
y → 0
z → 0
```

All three variables are assigned the value `0`.

### Another Example

```python
first = second = third = "Python"
```

Now:

```text
first  → "Python"
second → "Python"
third  → "Python"
```

---

## 19. Multiple Assignment: Matching Values

When multiple variables and multiple values are written together, the values are assigned in their corresponding positions.

Example:

```python
name, age = "Rahul", 18
```

The first value goes to the first variable:

```text
name → "Rahul"
```

The second value goes to the second variable:

```text
age → 18
```

Another example:

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
```

The result is:

```text
a → 10
b → 20
c → 30
```

---

## 20. A Complete Example

Consider this program:

```python
# Student information
student_name = "Rahul"
student_age = 18

student_age = 19

print(student_name)
print(student_age)
```

Let's understand it step by step.

### Step 1

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

The value `"Rahul"` is assigned to `student_name`.

### Step 2

```python
student_age = 18
```

The value `18` is assigned to `student_age`.

### Step 3

```python
student_age = 19
```

The value of `student_age` is reassigned.

Now:

```text
student_age → 19
```

### Step 4

```python
print(student_name)
print(student_age)
```

The current values of the variables are displayed.

Output:

```text
Rahul
19
```

# 21. Common Beginner Mistakes

## Mistake 1: Starting a Variable Name with a Number

Incorrect:

```python
1name = "Rahul"
```

Correct:

```python
name1 = "Rahul"
```

---

## Mistake 2: Using Spaces in Variable Names

Incorrect:

```python
student name = "Rahul"
```

Correct:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
```

---

## Mistake 3: Forgetting Case Sensitivity

Consider:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
print(Student_name)
```

`student_name` and `Student_name` are different names.

Always use the same capitalization.

---

## Mistake 4: Using a Keyword as a Variable Name

Avoid names such as:

```python
class = "B.Tech"
```

Choose a meaningful alternative:

```python
course_name = "B.Tech"
```

---

## Mistake 5: Confusing Assignment with Comparison

Remember:

```python
age = 18
```

means assignment.

It tells Python to assign `18` to `age`.

Do not assume that `=` is being used for a mathematical comparison.

Comparison operators will be introduced later.

---

## Mistake 6: Using Meaningless Names Everywhere

Instead of:

```python
x = "Rahul"
y = 18
```

prefer:

```python
student_name = "Rahul"
student_age = 18
```

when these values represent a student's information.

---
